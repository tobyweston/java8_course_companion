## λ Basic Syntax

Let's take a look at the basic lambda syntax.

A lambda is basically an anonymous block of functionality. It's a lot like using an anonymous class instance. For example, if we want to sort an array in Java, we can use the `Arrays.sort` method which takes an instance of the `Comparator` interface.

It would look something like this.

    Arrays.sort(numbers, new Comparator<Integer>() {
        @Override
        public int compare(Integer first, Integer second) {
            return first.compareTo(second);
        }
    });

The `Comparator` instance here is a an abstract piece of the functionality; it means nothing on its own; it's only when it's used by the sort method that it has purpose.

Using Java's new syntax, you can replace this with a lambda which looks like this


    Arrays.sort(numbers, (first, second) -> first.compareTo(second));

It's a more succinct way of achieving the same thing. In fact, Java treats this as if it were an instance of the `Comparator` class. If we were to extract a variable for the lambda (the second parameter), it's type would be `Comparator<Integer>` just like the anonymous instance above.


    Comparator<Integer> ascending = (first, second) -> first.compareTo(second);
    Arrays.sort(numbers, ascending);


Because `Comparator` has only a single abstract method on it; `compareTo`, the compiler can piece together that when we have an anonymous block like this, we really mean an instance of `Comparator`.  It can do this thanks to a couple of the other new features that we'll talk about later; functional interfaces and improvements to type inference.


### Syntax Breakdown

You can always convert from using a single abstract method to a using lambda.

Let's say we have an an interface `Example` with a method `apply`, returning some type and taking some argument


    interface Example {
        R apply(A arg);
    }

We could instantiate an instance with something like this;

    new Example() {
        @Override
        public R apply(A args) {
            body
        }
    };


And to convert to a lambda, we basically trim the fat. We drop the instantiation and annotation, drop the method details which leaves just the argument list and the body.


    (args) {
        body
    }

we then introduce the new arrow symbol to indicate both that the whole thing is a lambda and that what follows is the body and that's our basic lambda syntax.


    (args) -> {
        body
    }


Let's take the sorting example from earlier through these steps. We start with the anonymous instance:


    Arrays.sort(numbers, new Comparator<Integer>() {
        @Override
        public int compare(Integer first, Integer second) {
            return first.compareTo(second);
        }
    });


and trim the instantiation and method signature


    Arrays.sort(numbers, (Integer first, Integer second) {
        return first.compareTo(second);
    });

introduce the lambda


    Arrays.sort(numbers, (Integer first, Integer second) -> {
        return first.compareTo(second);
    });

and we're done. There's a couple of optimisations we can do though. You can drop the types if the compiler knows enough to infer them.


    Arrays.sort(numbers, (first, second) -> {
        return first.compareTo(second);
    });

and for simple expressions, you can drop the braces to produce a lambda expression


    Arrays.sort(numbers, (first, second) -> first.compareTo(second));


In this case, the compiler can infer enough to know what you mean. The single statement returns a value consistent with the interface, so it says, "no need to tell me that you're going to return something, I can see that for myself".


For single argument interface methods, you can even drop the first brackets. For example the lambda taking an argument `x` and returning `x + 1`;


    (x) -> x + 1

can be written without the brackets


    x -> x + 1



### Summary

Let's recap with a summary of the syntax options.

{title="Syntax Summary", lang="java", line-numbers="on"}
~~~~~~~
(int x, int y) -> { return x + y; }
(x, y) -> { return x + y; }
(x, y) -> x + y;
x -> x * 2
() -> System.out.println(“Hey there!”);
System.out::println;
~~~~~~~


The first example (`(int x, int y) -> { return x + y; }`) is the most verbose way to create a lambda. The arguments to the function along with their types are in parenthesise, followed by the new arrow syntax and then the body; the code block to be executed.

You can often drop the types from the argument list, like `(x, y) -> { return x + y; }`. The compiler will use type inference here to try and guess the types. It does this based on the context that you're trying to use the lambda in.

If your code block returns something or is a single line expression, you can drop the braces and return statement, for example `(x, y) -> x + y;`.

In the case of only a single argument, you can drop the parentheses `x -> x * 2`

If you have no arguments at all, the 'hamburger' symbol is needed, `() -> System.out.println(“Hey there!”);`.

In the interest of completeness, there is another variation; a kind of shortcut to a lambda called a _method reference_. An example is something like `System.out::println;`, which is basically a short cut to the lambda `(value -> System.out.prinltn(value)`.

We're going to talk about method references in more detail later, so for now, just be aware that they exist and can be used anywhere you can use a lambda.
