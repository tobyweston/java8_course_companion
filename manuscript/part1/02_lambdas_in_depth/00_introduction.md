In this section, we'll take a look at things in a little more detail and talk about some related topics, things like

  * functional interfaces
  * method and constructor references
  * scope and effectively final variables
  * exception transparency and
  * as we've talked about how lambdas aren't just syntactic sugar, we'll have a look at the bytecode lambdas produce
  * the differences between lambdas and closures
