-# Introduction

Welcome to Java Lambdas: an in-depth guide to Java 8 Lambdas.

Java underwent huge changes in it's version 8 release. A lot was driven by the perception that Java was becoming long in the tooth. To compete with modern, functional programming languages, Java 8 introduced functional programming constructs like lambdas to better support a more functional style.

This book offers a concise explanation of lambdas and various other features required to make them work in Java. As well as offering background, syntax and usage examples of lambdas, the book describes many of the other features introduced in Java 8; things like functional interfaces and type inference. 

One thing to note is that the book does not cover the new stream APIs beyond a general introduction.
