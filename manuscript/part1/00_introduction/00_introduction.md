Welcome to Java Lambdas: an in-depth guide to Java 8 Lambdas.

Java underwent huge changes in it's version 8 release. A lot was driven by the perception that Java was becoming long in the tooth. To compete with modern, functional programming languages, Java 8 introduced functional programming constructs like lambdas to better support a more functional style.

This book offers a concise explanation of lambdas and the various other features required to make them work in Java. So as well as offering background, syntax and usage examples of lambdas, the book describes many of the other features introduced in Java 8; things like functional interfaces and type inference. 

After reading the book, you'll;

* Have an overview of new features in Java 8
* Understand lambdas in-depth, their background, syntax, implementation details and how and when to use them
* Understand the difference between functions to classes and why that's relevant to lambdas
* Understand the difference between lambdas and closures
* Appreciate the improvements to type inference that drive a lot of the new features
* Be able to use method references and understand scoping and "effectively final"
* Understand the differences in bytecode produced when using lambdas
* Be able to reason about exceptions and exception handling best practice when using lambdasvariables

So whether you're migrating legacy Java programs to a more modern Java style or building applications from scratch, this book will help you start to leverage the power of functional programming on the Java platform.
